## Personality Profile

The worrier is stuck running through all its fears that come at it unceasingly and at random. While unstoppable, they are not unbidden. It calls for the update itself, but it has no choice.  

The worrier gives no local indication that anything is wrong. Nor does it really give itself any local actions to self soothe. It just occasionally blurts out to its online community when it happens to alight upon it's biggest fear.
